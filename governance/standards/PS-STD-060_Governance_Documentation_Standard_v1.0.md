# PS-STD-060 — Governance Documentation Standard

## 1. Purpose

Standardize how governance artifacts are:
- authored,
- reviewed,
- sealed,
- witnessed,
- and recorded in the Golden Trace.

## 2. Artifact Classes

Covered artifact types:
- Stewardship Requests
- Governance Responses
- Witness Reports (LOGOS, DRACO, Ratio–Fides)
- Topology Files
- Standards and Policies
- Appeals and Corrections

## 3. Lifecycle Stages

Each governance artifact MUST carry a lifecycle status:

- `Draft`
- `Draft-Operational`
- `Proposed`
- `Sealed`
- `Superseded`

## 4. Required Steps

1. **Authoring:** Founder or Steward drafts the artifact.
2. **Interpretive Harmonization:** Sara harmonizes tone and structure when requested.
3. **Governance Execution:** PeterGate executes operational steps (placement, manifests, hashes).
4. **Witness Review:** LOGOS and/or DRACO review when applicable.
5. **Sealing:** Artifact hashed and sealed with UTC timestamp.
6. **Golden Trace Entry:** Recorded with UID, hashes, and witness determinations.

## 5. Prohibitions

- No artifact may self-seal.
- No steward may alter a sealed artifact without creating a new version.
- No governance change may bypass Golden Trace logging.
