# PortusSophia™ Lab

**Governance & Engineering Node**

---

## Purpose

This is the **operational workspace** of PortusSophia™—the machine room where governance standards, witness cycles, CI workflows, and structural integrity enforcement are defined, maintained, and executed.

This node is **not public-facing**. It is a technical resource for:

- Stewards executing governance workflows
- Engineers implementing integrity verification
- Auditors reviewing structural compliance
- Developers building tooling around PortusSophia™ architecture

---

## What Lives Here

### Governance

- **Standards** — Formal specifications (PS-STD-001, PS-STD-060, PS-STD-140, etc.)
- **Witness Cycles** — Templates and procedures for LOGOS/DRACO reviews
- **Stewardship Workflows** — Role definitions, cycle execution, boundary enforcement
- **Appeals** — Structural appeal templates and resolution procedures
- **WebKernel Topology** — Domain mappings, audience rules, content restrictions

### Engineering

- **CI Workflows** — Hash generation, UICH validation, drift scanning
- **Scripts** — Validation tools, integrity verification, boundary checks
- **Diagnostics** — Drift models, risk maps, stability analyses

### Recipes

- **WebKernel Engineering Recipes** — Repeatable patterns for content generation, node activation, governance execution

---

## Boundary Constraints

This node maintains **strictest boundaries** of all PortusSophia™ subdomains.

### ✅ Allowed

- Governance documents and standards
- Engineering specifications
- Witness cycle templates
- CI workflows and automation
- Topology documentation
- Diagnostics and drift analysis
- Stewardship procedures
- System recipes

### ❌ Prohibited

- **Canon** (PS-CAN artifacts referenced externally only)
- **Narrative** (personal, emotional, historical content)
- **Founder identity** (resume, statements, personal reflections)
- **Public orientation** (belongs to Public Node)
- **Academic research** (belongs to MIT Node)
- **Interpretive content** (meaning-making narratives)

**Principle:**
The Lab Node is a **cold workspace**—structure, not story.
